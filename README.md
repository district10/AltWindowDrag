# AltWindowDrag

Drag window by holding Alt key and dragging it, works on Windows.

It's just a mirror & backup of [Get the Linux Alt+Window Drag Functionality in Windows](http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/get-the-linux-altwindow-drag-functionality-in-windows/).

I recompiled the binary using AltHotkey's ahk2exe.
